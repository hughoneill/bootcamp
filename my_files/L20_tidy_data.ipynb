    "## Tidy data\n",
    "[Hadley Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham) wrote a [great article](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) in favor of \"tidy data.\" Tidy `DataFrames` follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each variable is a column.\n",
    "2. Each observation is a row.\n",
    "3. Each type of observation has its own separate `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is less pretty to visualize as a table, but we rarely look at data in tables. Indeed, the representation of data which is convenient for visualization is different from that which is convenient for analysis. A tidy `DataFrame` is almost always **much** easier to work with than non-tidy formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may raise some objections about tidy data. Here are a few, and my responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objection:** Looking at a table of tidy data is ugly. It is not intuitively organized. I would almost never display a tidy data table in a publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** Correct! Having tabular data in a format that is easy to read as a human studying a table is a very different thing than having it in a format that is easy to explore and work with using a computer. As my friend Daniel Chen put it, \"There are data formats that are better for reporting and data formats that are better for analysis.\" We are using the tidy data frames for analysis, not reporting (though we will see in the coming lessons that having the data in a tidy format makes making plots much easier, and plots are a key medium for reporting.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objection:** Isn't it better to sometimes have data arranged in other ways? Say in a matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** This is certainly true for things like images, or raster-style data in general. It makes more sense to organize an image in a 2D matrix than to have it organized as a data frame with three columns (row in image, column in image, intensity of pixel), where each row corresponds to a single pixel. For an image, indexing it by row and column is always unambiguous, `my_image[i, j]` means the pixel at row `i` and column `j`.\n",
    "For other data, though, the matrix layout suffers from the fact that there may be more than one way to construct a matrix. If you know a data frame is tidy, you already know its structure. You need only to ask what the columns are, and then you immediately know how to access data. In other formats, you might have to read and write extensive comments to understand the structure of the data. Of course, you can read and write comments, but it opens the door for the possibility of misinterpretation or mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objection:** But what about time series? Clearly, that can be in matrix format. One column is time, and then subsequent columns are observations made at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** Yes, that is true. But then the matrix-style described could be considered tidy, since each row is a single observation (time point) that has many facets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objection:** Isn't this an inefficient use of memory? There tend to be lots of repeated entries in tidy data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** Yes, there are more efficient ways of storing and accessing data. But for data sets that are not \"big data,\" this is seldom a real issue. The extra expense in memory, as well as the extra expense in access, is a small prices to pay for the simplicity and speed of the human user in accessing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objection:** Once it's tidy, we pretty much have to use Boolean indexing to get what we want, and that can be slower than other methods of accessing data. What about performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** See the previous response. Speed of access really only because of a problem with big, high-throughput data sets. In those cases, there are often many things you need to be clever about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** I really think that tidying a data set allows for fluid exploration. We will focus on tidy data sets going forward. The techniques for bringing untidy data into tidy format use many of Pandas's functions, but are largely beyond the scope of this bootcamp. You will explore that a little bit in the exercises, but for more of the bootcamp, our data sets are already tidy."
